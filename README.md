# payphone-selfbot
## A discord automatic messaging base for payphone-like bots.
### Please don't use this for PayPhone! We only use it as an example

# Setup
Install Node.JS
Run setup.sh on unix-like OS's and setup.ps1 on Windows
Input correct variables
Make a file named "names" and leave it blank.


- This is a selfbot, and against Discord TOS. We do not take responsibility for any bans issued.
- We are not associated with Discord.

# Future plans
- Less hardcoding on variables
- ~~json reading for configs~~
- ~~A script to automatically make the said json~~
- More ease of use for non techy people
