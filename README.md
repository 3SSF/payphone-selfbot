# payphone-selfbot
## A discord automatic messaging base for payphone-like bots.
### Please don't use this for PayPhone! We only use it as an example

# Setup
Install Node.JS

Run setup.sh on unix-like OS's 

Input correct variables

Make a file named "names" and leave it blank.

# This is a selfbot, and against Discord TOS. We do not take responsibility for any bans issued.
- We are not associated with Discord nor the Discord.js-selfbot project.


>note: this only works 100% on Linux.. but doesnt on Windows so if you find a bug please create an issue, it is not heavily tested on other os's besides linux :3 

# Future plans
- Less hardcoding on variables
- ~~json reading for configs~~
- ~~A script to automatically make the said json~~
- More ease of use for non techy people
- More generality on the use of this bot
- Cleaner overall code
- 100% compatibility on window
- GUI, yes, im really planning this, i dont know if this will ever happen.

# Contributing to the bot
### If you plan on contributing, then please follow these standards:

1. camelCase - Use camelCasing for our variable names.
2. variable declaration - Declare related variables near the top, close to eachother.
3. constant variabels - Declare variables as constants if that is feasable.
4. asynchronous execution - Anything after initialization, must be asynchronous to prevent delays.
5. descriptive function names - Any functions that are added, must have descriptive names that are easy to understand.
6. descriptive variable names - Same thing as functions, but with variables.
