# payphone-selfbot
## A discord automatic messaging base for payphone-like bots.
### Please don't use this for PayPhone! We only use it as an example

Make a file named "names" and leave it blank.


- This is a selfbot, and against Discord TOS. We do not take responsibility for any bans issued.
- We are not associated with Discord nor the Discord.js-selfbot project.

>note: this only works 100% on non-mentally-deranged-os's™️.. but doesnt on mentally deranged ones *cough cough* windows *cough* so if you find a bug please create an issue, it is not heavily tested on other os's besides linux :3

# Future plans
- Less hardcoding on variables
- ~~json reading for configs~~
- ~~A script to automatically make the said json~~
- More ease of use for non techy people
- More generality on the use of this bot
- Cleaner overall code
- 100% compatibility on windows
- GUI, yes, im really planning this, i dont know if this will ever happen.
