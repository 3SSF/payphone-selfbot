# WARNING!
This is a Windows only developing branch, focused specifically on Windows, do NOT ask to merge windows version with main, as the changes are too much to go with the main branch's code.

This branch has effectively been deprecated as we no longer have any developer for Windows branch; it does not currently work as far as im aware, neither can i test it to make sure it works as im not on Windows.
If you would like to work on this branch, make sure to follow contribution guidelines listen in the main (Linux) branch's readme.

# Known Bugs
 - Ignored user ids doesn't work.

# Future plans
- More ease of use for non techy people
- More generality on the use of this bot
- Cleaner overall code
- Full parity between the versions (Linux has more features, therefor cooler, signed 3SSF)

# This is a selfbot, and against Discord TOS. We do not take responsibility for any bans issued.
- We are not associated with Discord nor the Discord.js-selfbot project.
